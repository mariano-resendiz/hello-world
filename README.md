# hello-world
First Repository:
I am Mariano Resendiz and I'm learning more about computational tools so I can be prepared for a PhD in bioinformatics/genomics.

I like learning about genetics and want to use statistics and computer science to contribute to the community of scientists that help solve or alleviate epidemiological, pharmacogenomic, public health, and social issues.
